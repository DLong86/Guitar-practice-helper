				Searching through hundreds of videos on Youtube to find the right
				teacher or song tutorial can cost valuable practice time when beginning
				to play the guitar. We are not a tutorial based site, no, instead we
				help you with a guitar study plan unique for you. Pick the time you want
				to practice, the things you want to concentrate on most, and the songs
				you want to learn, and we'll provide you with a structured plan, with
				possible techniques you might have neglected.

			<h3 className="text-4xl font-thin ">
				Our sole purpose is to help you progress from being a beginner guitar
				player to an advanced experienced player whilst maintaing the fun and
				self-improvement that comes with playing guitar.
			</h3>
			<p className="text-2xl">
				We are not claiming to make you an absolute guitar wizard in 30 days or
				whatever clickbait titles are commonly seen on Youtube guitar tutorial
				videos, No. We want you to go at your own pace and concentrate on the
				things you enjoy most, but just adding more structure to your playing
				time to help you progress.
			</p>
			<h3 className="text-4xl font-thin ">
				From absolute beginners to seasoned pros...

			<p className="text-2xl">
				let us help give a bit of guidance and fine-tuning (sorry pun!) to your
				playing time.
